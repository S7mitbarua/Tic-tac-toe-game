# Tic-tac-toe-game
This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns to place their symbols ('X' or 'O') in an empty cell. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.

# How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and each cell is represented by its row and column index (0, 1, or 2). Players take turns to input their moves. During your turn, enter the row and column index where you want to place your symbol.The game will display the updated board after each move. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all cells are filled, and no player has three symbols in a row, the game ends in a draw.
